## Setup on Replit

### 1. Fork / import this repository

Open [Replit](https://replit.com) and create a new Repl from this GitHub repo.

### 2. Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**.
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts.
3. Copy the API token you receive (looks like `123456:ABC-DEF…`).

### 3. Set the environment variable

In the Replit sidebar click **Secrets** (🔒) and add:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Your token from BotFather |

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Replit runs this automatically on first start if you use a `pyproject.toml`
or if the Run button is configured to execute `pip install` first.

### 5. Run the bot

Click **Run** in Replit, or execute:

```bash
python main.py
```

The bot will start polling for Telegram updates.

## Usage

| Command | Description |

| `/get_link` | Retrieve the last captured offer link |
| `/status` | View current session info and device profile |

### Typical flow

```

## Technical Notes

- **Headless Chrome** is used via Selenium with mobile emulation matching
  the Pixel 10 Pro screen dimensions (390 × 844, pixel ratio 3.0).
- A new **IMEI**, **Android ID**, and **Chrome version patch** are generated
  for every session using the `device_simulator.py` module.
- The **user agent** keeps the Pixel 10 Pro identity constant while varying
  the Chrome patch version and Android ID to reduce fingerprinting.
- Credentials are stored **in memory only** and never written to disk.
  The Telegram message containing the password is deleted immediately after
  being read.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Google Chrome / Chromium installed (Replit provides this)
- `chromedriver` on PATH (managed automatically by `webdriver-manager`)
